# Fintual Challenge

This is a challenge to apply for a dev position at [Fintual](https://fintual.com).

The challenge states the following:

> Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks and a "Profit" method that receives 2 dates and returns the profit of the Portfolio between those dates. Assume each Stock has a "Price" method that receives a date and returns its price.
>
> Bonus Track: make the Profit method return the "annualized return" of the portfolio between the given dates.

## How to run this

I decided to solve this by using Rust because of the safety features, and hopefully to impress you guys ðŸ˜œ.

To run a sample portfolio just run:

```shell
cargo run
```

To run the unit tests:

```shell
cargo test
```
